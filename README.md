# socketcluster-clj

A [SocketCluster](https://socketcluster.io/) Client library for Clojure. This client wraps [socketcluster-client-java](https://github.com/sacOO7/socketcluster-client-java), but where appropriate aims to be more idiomatic and succinct.

## Usage

```clojure
lein repl

;; define
=> (require '[socketcluster-clj.client :as sc-client])
=> (require '[socketcluster-clj.listeners :as sc-listen])
=> (require '[socketcluster-clj.events :as sc-event])
=> (require '[socketcluster-clj.channels :as sc-ch])
=> (def sc-server-url "ws://localhost:8000/socketcluster/")
=> (def my-socket (sc-client/new-socket sc-server-url)  
or
=> (sc-client/set-url my-socket sc-server-url)

;; set listener(s)
=> (sc-listen/set-listener my-socket)

;; connect
=> (sc-client/connect my-socket)
=> (sc-event/emit my-socket {"some" "data"})

;; CHANNELS -

;; subscribe

=> (sc-ch/create-channel my-socket "channel-name")
=> (sc-ch/set-channel-listener my-socket "channel-name" (fn [name data] (print "received on channel => " name "some data => " data)))
=> (sc-ch/subscribe my-socket "channel-name")

;; publish
=> (sc-ch/publish my-socket "channel-name" {"some" "data"})
```

for more, have a look in `src/socketcluster_clj/<ns>.clj` for every function you can call.


### NPE Issue

if you get the following error when trying to connect:

```bash
Exception in thread "OkHttp Dispatcher" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at io.github.sac.Socket$1.onFailure(Socket.java:185)
	at okhttp3.internal.ws.RealWebSocket.failWebSocket(RealWebSocket.java:546)
	at okhttp3.internal.ws.RealWebSocket$2.onResponse(RealWebSocket.java:206)
```

you need to `(sc-listen/set-listener <socket>)` **before** connecting.
